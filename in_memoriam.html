               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p>Christine Michelle Lighthill, 53, passed away on Monday, July 10, 2017 at Health First Hospital in Viera, FL, after a courageous battle against cancer. She was born on May 13, 1964 in Flint, MI, to James and Virginia Coggins. </p>
               <p>Christine grew up in Otisville, MI, and graduated from Lakeville High School in 1982. After high school, she made Florida her home. She was successful throughout her career and always loved a challenge. Her last career move she found to be the most rewarding, working for the University of Florida Ped-I-Care Program. She loved to be able to make a difference in the children's lives. </p>
               <p>She married Matthew Lighthill in 1993 in Melbourne, FL, and they celebrated 24 years of marriage this past June. </p>
               <p>Christine was very active in her community and she touched many lives both directly and indirectly. She believed in giving back and did so in many ways, the largest being the annual “Battle of the Bridges” triathlon, which she owned, organized, and directed. </p>
               <p>The funds raised helped many local organizations, including the Cancer Care Centers of Brevard Foundation. For &nbsp;her efforts, she received the 2013 Central Florida Humanitarian Award, and she served on the Board of Directors of the Cancer Care Centers of Brevard Foundation. She was devout in her faith and was a member of the Ascension Catholic Community Church. Christine was an avid triathlete and traveled the states looking for another challenge. </p>
               <p>She enjoyed long walks at her favorite spots (the wetlands, the beach, and Mom and Dad's). </p>
               <p>She also enjoyed a good book, spending time with family and friends, and her beloved dog Aniol. </p>
               <p>Christine is survived by her spouse Matt of Melbourne, FL; her parents James and Virginia Coggins of Southern Pines, NC; in-laws Wayne and Virginia Sue Lighthill of Melbourne, FL; brothers Steven (Lynette) Coggins of Davison, MI, and Mark (Jaynie) Coggins of Otisville, MI; brothers-in-law Mark (Dorean) Lighthill of Dothan, AL, Darrell Lighthill of Lincolnton, NC, and Paul Lighthill of Melbourne, FL; and many nieces and nephews. </p>
               <p>A memorial service will be held at Ascension Catholic Community Church at a later date. </p>
               <p>In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made to Colorectal Cancer Research. Condolences may be left on the Brownlie &amp; Maxwell online guest book at http:// <a href="www.brownliemaxwell">www.brownliemaxwell.</a>com . </p>

                       <p>Gloria A. Lohner, a devout Catholic, passed away on Saturday, July 16. </p>
                       <p>Daughter of John and Ann (McKiernan) Eberlein, Gloria was born in New York City in 1935. &nbsp;She attended Bishop McDonald High School, an honor awarded to two girls from each Catholic parish in her diocese. &nbsp;Following high school, Gloria attended New York University where she earned her Bachelor's Degree. </p>
                       <p>In 1958, she met her future husband, Paul E. Lohner, on a blind date. &nbsp;After a whirlwind romance, they married and moved to Point Pleasant, New Jersey, where Gloria taught first grade, and Paul became the first Recreation Director in Brick Township, New Jersey. &nbsp;After the birth of their two daughters, Eileen and Linda, they moved to Pleasantville, New York&nbsp;in 1965. &nbsp;David, their son, was born shortly thereafter.&nbsp; </p>
                       <p>Gloria was a beloved and highly regarded substitute teacher in Pleasantville and became involved in many social activities including Newcomers, PTA, Pleasantville International Association, Gourmet Club, Candlewood Yacht Club, etc. &nbsp;She was a dedicated parishioner of Holy Innocents Church and instilled in her children the importance of God and family. </p>
                       <p>Gloria had a successful career in real estate both in Pleasantville, New York and in Melbourne Beach, Florida, where she and Paul moved shortly after his retirement. </p>

               <p>Mary Lou Fabrizzio, (nee Petrozelli), 51, of Madison, N.J., formerly of Rutherford, N.J., died peacefully on Oct. 7, 2011. The funeral is on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. from the Collins Calhoun Funeral Home, 19 Lincoln Ave., Rutherford, N.J., followed by 11 a.m. Mass of Christian Burial in Queen of Peace Church, 174 Ridge Road, North Arlington, N.J. Interment is in Holy Cross Cemetery, North Arlington. The family will receive friends on Tuesday from 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 p.m. Mary Lou was born Dec. 3, 1959, in Jersey City, N.J., to her loving parents, Patrick and Mary Petrozelli. She was a physical education teacher for the Jersey City Board of Education for 16-1/2 years. She belonged to the King of Kings Ministry in Basking Ridge, N.J., and was also involved in missionary work in her community. Mary Lou was a consummate example of what it means to be a good wife, an excellent mother, and an awesome sister. She was a very generous woman who enjoyed her friends and had an enormous place in her heart for her family. Mary Lou's first thought was always &quot;how can I make the lives of the people around me better,&quot; and she always found a way to make that happen. She was known for her kindness, gentleness, humility, purity of heart and for bringing great joy to everyone around her. Most of all, she served as a model of confidence and spiritual strength. Mary Lou exemplified how extraordinary ordinary Christianity can be; she was a disciple of Jesus Christ who lived a life filled with the Holy Spirit of God. Mary Lou was never one to keep her convictions to herself, nor to consider a situation hopeless. She knew what she believed and was fearless in expressing it. Mary Lou loved to share the Lord with people. She was passionate about evangelism and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. She taught many adult Bible classes and was especially gifted on the works of the Holy Spirit and healing. She always turned to the Bible for understanding and her unforgettable gift was to penetrate and explain the Scriptures. Mary Lou traveled to many places to share her faith; from the inner cities of New Jersey and New York to places like Haiti and Trinidad. She committed her life to one overarching purpose: the preaching and teaching of God's Word. Summarizing her life of service, Mary Lou deserves an honored place among the heroines of the faith. Remember her as vigorous and strong, happy and enthusiastic, always with the same goal in mind, making other lives better. Mary Lou was the beloved wife of Ricky Fabrizzio, and adored mother to son Joshua and daughter Faith. She will be missed by her sisters, Judy Petrozelli; JoAnn Bledsoe and husband Steven, and Linda Petrozelli and husband David Lentz,and her nieces, Zoe, Phoebe Anna and Mia Bella. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to a special college fund account that has been created in the name of Joshua and Faith Fabrizzio. Envelopes will be available at the funeral home. <br>

               <p>ALLEN, Caroline E. Allen (nee Duffy) <br>
                 November 21, 1929 - September 23, 2011 <br>
                 Our mother passed away peacefully in her sleep on the bright sunny morning of the first day of fall, joining our dad to watch over us. She was a true matriarch who devoted her life to her family. <br>
                 Beloved wife of the late Thomas Edward Allen, who predeceased her on November 26, 1991. Loving mother to Edward (Trisha), Jefferson (Tonette), Colleen (Cameron), Maryann (Michael) and Cathy (Carl). <br>
                 Cherished Namie to Jennifer, Jessica, Eric, Jaime, Emily, River, Rory, Daniel, Colton, Chelsea, Walker, Derek, Kail and Briar. Great- grandmother to Katia, Alixandra, Zoe, Thomas and Annabelle. <br>
                 Mom grew up in lower town Ottawa, the youngest child of Rose (nee Coby) and John Duffy. She was proud of her strong Irish roots and Catholic upbringing, and learned from her own parents the importance of family. As the youngest, she was known as Sissy to her late sisters and brothers - Katherine, Margaret, Mary, Madeline, Leona, Patrick, Angus and John (Jack) - and as Aunt Sissy to her many nieces and nephews. <br>
                 Mom's first job was at the British Bank Note, at the age of fourteen. Wearing her older sister's clothing, she convinced her future employer that she was much older than she was. She married at sixteen, and stayed at the Bank Note until the birth of her first child at the age of seventeen. For the next twenty years, Mom stayed at home raising her five children, building a home filled with love and commitment to family. She and Dad built our family home on a quiet tree-lined street in the west end of Ottawa in the late 1950s. As her kids grew up and financial pressures grew with them, Mom started her career at the CBC as a keypunch operator. When our dad became ill and needed her care, she retired from a successful career there of 25 years, with many lasting friendships and countless stories about her time at the CBC. <br>
                 Mom loved to travel, and visited Europe, South America and many parts of Canada and the U.S. She was always up for the next adventure. She and Dad made the trip to Florida in winter for many years, usually joined by some or all of her kids and their growing families. After Dad's passing and her retirement, she purchased a second home in Melbourne Beach, Florida, which became a favourite gathering spot for her ever-growing grandfamily, where we shared countless meals, watched our kids learn how to swim, and shared love and laughter. Mom also made many great friends there over the years. <br>
                 At home in Ottawa, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners were a time when all of us came together as brothers and sisters, in- laws, aunts and uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins. All of us aware of how blessed we were to have each other. <br>
                 Mom had a quiet and steady faith. She said her favourite prayer every night and whenever she thought any of us were in need of it. Sunday Mass with Father Steve was always a must for Mom and her daughters, followed by breakfast at the local diner. She and her girls were inseparable. Mom had one overriding rule. It was that nothing should ever come between family. That no matter the problem, we could get through it if we stick together as a family. She was our rock and our lighthouse, and will always be in our hearts. <br>
                 Our thanks to Dr. Hurdon, Taralynn (nurse), Milda and Karen of We Care, and the second floor staff at Bridlewood Trails for their care and kindness in these last few difficult months. <br>
                 Friends may pay their respects at the Garden Chapel of Tubman Funeral Homes, 3440 Richmond Road, (between Bayshore and Baseline Road) Nepean on Thursday, September 29 from 1:00 to 3:00 pm and 5:00 to 8:00 pm. <br>
                 Funeral Friday, September 30 at 11:00 am at St. Patrick's Church-Fallowfield, 15 Steeple Hill Crescent, Nepean, Ontario. Burial to follow at Pinecrest Cemetery, 2500 Baseline Road. <br>
                 A reception celebrating Mom's life will be held afterwards at 10 Brad's Court, Stittsville. <br>
