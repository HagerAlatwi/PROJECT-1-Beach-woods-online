            to do our part, not just sit and listen. April 12, about 80 volunteers dirtied
            their hands while using plastic ties to attach bare oyster shells to about 100
            plastic meshes, each with about 50 shell halves. Soon, Fla. Tech students will
            encircle our pier pilings with the populated meshes. Those blank shell surfaces
            will catch oyster “seeds”, or “spat”, naturally floating in the lagoon. Those
            spat will start a new oyster, shell and all. Each adult oyster amazingly
            filters over one gallon per hour of excess nutrients from the water. (Hope this
            isn't embellished too much.) Thanks to Bob Hinckley for getting BW involved,
            and to our BW Directors for authorizing buying the plastic mats to do our part.

            demonstrated the amazing evolution of rocket technology, that is, the recovery
            of the side-strapped solid boosters and the main first stage engine. If you

            launch and the booster returns. After over 70 years of space launches, still
