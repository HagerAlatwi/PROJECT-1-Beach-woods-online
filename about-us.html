          <h4>From Ocean to River</h4>
          <a>Beach Woods spans  the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean, on Brevard County's scenic Barrier Island. The area is rich in wildlife and is conveniently located close to shops, parks, restaurants, and the Melbourne Causeway. 
               <br><br>
               We are a gated entrance, beautifully landscaped, deed restricted community consisting of 393 units . These include town homes, villas, quads and single family residences, as well as a 6 story riverside condominium.
               <br><br>
               Our Amenities include Gated Entrances, Security Cameras; Pier with Fishing Station; Dunes Crossover with Benches for viewing the Space launches from the Cape; Club House (function room with kitchen and bath); Honor System Library, 2 Heated Pools; Courts for Racquetball, Tennis, Pickleball, Basketball; Health Club  (with workout equipment), Sauna; Playground Area for Children with Barbecue and Picnic Table Area; Hand Launch Ramp, Bocce Court. Benches along the Indian River for viewing the beautiful sunsets. Many recreational and social activities take place regularly.
               <br><br>
               BEACH WOODS is a planned unit development (P.U.D.). We are hooked up to the City of Melbourne water and sewer system,  and to FPL for electric service. You own the land under your building as well as the building itself.  The homeowners are responsible for their own flood insurance and homeowners insurance policy.  The buildings are concrete block construction with firewalls between each unit that extend up to the roof line of each unit.  The homeowners are responsible for the maintenance of the outside of their building and the area within their fence line. All outside repairs (fences, painting, roof tiles, doors) and changes, additions, deletions to your building  MUST be approved by the Architectural Control Committee before work starts.  Common grounds plantings MUST be approved by the Manager and/or the Landscape Committee. All homeowners are responsible for the repairs of their sidewalks and driveways. 
               For a nominal fee you can store your Boat or RV in our Boat/RV fenced yard,  as they are not permitted to be parked in driveways.  Commercial vehicles must  be parked in garages as they are not allowed to be parked in driveways in Beach Woods.  Only one pet per unit is allowed.
               <br><br>
               The Homeowners Association Maintenance Fee is voted on the third week in April by the Homeowners each year and covers all landscaping and grounds maintenance outside of the fenced areas, including maintenance of sprinkler systems, roads and walkways, lights, and amenities. We also have a Bulk Cable contract with Bright House Networks for all units except the condo.  Cable service includes all channels except the premium and a-la-carte services. Riverside Condominium building residents have their own cable contract, and an additional condo fee for shared building maintenance.
               <br><br>
               Beach Woods employs a Manager  and Grounds Maintenance workers. The office staff consists of a Book Keeper and a Receptionist/Secretary.  Beach Woods hires an outside Lawn Service for the grounds..</a>
